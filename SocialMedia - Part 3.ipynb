    "Natural Language Processing involves a series of operations on an input text, each building off of the previous step to add additional insight and undertanding.  Thus, many NLP packages run as pipeline processors providing modular components at each stage of the process. Separating key steps into discrete packages provides needed modularity, as developers can modify and customize individual components as needed. spaCy, like other NLP tools including [GATE](https://gate.ac.uk/) and [cTAKES](https://ctaes.apache.org)  operate on such a model. Although the specific components of each pipeline vary from system to system (and from tasks to task, the key tasks are roughly similar:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Tokenizing*: splitting the text into words, punctuation, and other markers.\n",
    "2. *Part of speech tagging*: Classifying terms as nouns, verbs, adjective, adverbs, ec.\n",
    "3. *Dependency Parsing* or *Chunking*: Defining relationships between tokens (subject and object of sentence) and grouping into noun and veb phrases.\n",
    "4. *Named Entity Recognition*: Mapping words or phrases to standard vocabularies or other common, known values. This step is often key for linking free text to accepted terms for diseases, symptoms, and/or anatomic locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these steps might be accomplished through rules, machine learning models, or some combination of approaches. After these initial steps are complete, results might be used to identify relationships between items in the text, build classifiers, or otherwise conduct further analysis. We'll get into these topics later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [spaCy documentation](https://spaCy.io/usage/spaCy-101) and [cTAKES default pipeline description](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CTAKES/Default+Clinical+Pipeline) provide two examples of how these components might be arranged in practice.

Revise `filterTweetTokens` to add any named entities to the end of the token list.  \n",

One possible approach to this would be to further revise the lemmatizer to reduce these entries to common forms - perhaps 'vape' and '#vape'. Revise the `getTwitterNLP` routine above to include a lemmatizer that handles these cases."
